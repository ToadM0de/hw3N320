### About
This project was creating using a Node.js HTTP Server. path.join(), fs.readFileSynce(), and fs.existsSync were used to serve content and files.

### Weekly Recap
This week, we discussed async, await, promises, and HTTP Web Servers. While I have seen async, await, and HTTP Web Servers before, I would still consider them a new concept to me. 

| Words  | Definitions |
| --- | -------- | 
| Promises  | Object that represents eventual competion or failure of an asynchronous code    |
| Async |    Javascript function that always returns a Promise, allowing developers to write asynchronous code in a more readable and synchronous-like manner  |
| Await |    Put inside an async function to pause execution until a Promise resolves or rejects  |
| HTTP Web Server  | Server application that listens for HTTP requests and reesponds with approproate data or resources  |
